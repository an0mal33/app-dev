## Information about my favorite series/movie:

My current obsession right now is a series called **Bleach**.

It's an anime series from the mid-2000's where a red-head school boy named **Ichigo** who can see ghosts stumbles upon trouble when a *soul-reaper* enters his bedroom. This soul-reaper's name is **Rukia** and her mission is to elimate hollows that traspasses the human realm (a *hollow* is a type of spirit that never went to the afterlife and stayed too long in the living). Because of this encounter, she was forced to tranfer her powers to Ichigo to save his life from the hollow who was attacking his household. Now that Ichigo has Rukia's powers, he became the unofficial substitute soul-reaper and holds responsible for all hollow related attacks until Rukia regains her strength back.

It's a shame that I missed the chance of watching sereis this when I was younger as it never peeked my interest back then, until years later when a random youtube reel played a clip of their episode. It featured Ichigo minding his own business when all of a sudden Rukia came barging out of his closet, wearing his sister's pajamas and unknowingly spent most of her nights hiding there. This made me chuckle as it was so out of nowhere like why is there a girl sleeping in your closet? This sparked my curiosity and went ahead watching the series, needless to say I'm hooked and can't wait to finish the series once I'm done with all of my schoolwork!
